# Traveling Managment Platform

### Motivation and Description
While searching for a travel destination we all have often dealt with the uncertanity of which travel agency should I choose or if I am missing any occasions from travel agencies. On the other hand, even travel agencies would like to have a platform where they could be in direct contact with a targeted audience (clients who are ready to travel). Creating a platoform that could bring together traveling agencies with clients would be a good solution for this problem. 

Our software solution aims to have the below actors/ groups of users :
> Agency  would:
* Post their services and occasions.
* Create advertisments in order to be in the peak search pages of the users.
* Create sales for a targeted group of customers based on some criteria.
* Manage how a post is going
* See reviews from clients
* etc

> Client would:
* Search for specific traveling needs
* Have a historic of traveling with an agency in order to get sales
* Have a feed with the posts from companies he/she/they follow
* Review the service of the company
* Direct booking without any fees
